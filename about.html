        My name is Elizabeth "Annie" O'Farrell. I was born in the Republic of Ireland.
        I grew up in village called Prosperous in County Kildare, Ireland. When I was
        growing up, I wanted to be a teacher or run a bed & breakfast. My siblings are
        Eamonn, Finbar, Geraldine, and Dermot. My youngest sibling, Noel, passed away
        as a baby.My parents were Edward “Ned” O’Farrell and Nancy O’Farrell (Clifford).
        I have lived in Ireland, France, Germany, Greece, and Nebraska. I traveled around
        one summer with my friend and we stayed in many different European countries.
        I have worked in a hotel. I did civil service clerical work in Ireland. I worked
        as a store clerk in Ireland. I worked as a waitress. I worked as an au pair in
        France. I had my own Montessori school for a short time. I have been a teacher
        for most of my life. I worked part-time as an adjunct teacher at Metropolitan
        Community College (MCC) for a few years. I have worked at two separate
        Montessori schools during my career. I have worked at my current job for almost
        40 years. I currently teach at a Montessori school as a primary class teacher.
        The primary classes are from ages 3 – 6 (or when completed with Kindergarten).
        I have been married once. We divorced in 1997. I have one daughter and one
        granddaughter. In my free time, I enjoy reading, Jazzercise, baking, shopping,
        spending time with family and friends, traveling, going to the theater,
        crafting (knitting, sewing, and crocheting), drawing, and painting.My favorite
        book store is <a href="https://www.bookwormomaha.com/">The Bookworm</a> in Omaha.
        I am proud of graduating from Maynooth College. I am very proud of completing
        my master’s degree in business administration. I graduated at the same time as
        my daughter graduated from high school in 2005. One of my goals is to pursue a
        healthy lifestyle. Another one of my goals is to expand my spirituality.
