    <p>My name is Elizabeth "Annie" O'Farrell.</p>
    <p>I was born in the Republic of Ireland.</p>
    <p>I grew up in village called Prosperous in County Kildare, Ireland.</p>
    <p>When I was growing up, I wanted to be a teacher or run a bed & breakfast.</p>
    <p>My siblings are Eamonn, Finbar, Geraldine, and Dermot. My youngest sibling, Noel, passed away as a baby.</p>
    <p>My parents were Edward “Ned” O’Farrell and Nancy O’Farrell (Clifford).</p>
    <p>I have lived in Ireland, France, Germany, Greece, and Nebraska. I traveled around one summer with my friend and we stayed in many different European countries. </p>
    <p>I have worked in a hotel. I did civil service clerical work in Ireland. I worked as a store clerk in Ireland. I worked as a waitress. I worked as an au pair in France. I had my own Montessori school for a short time. I have been a teacher for most of my life. I worked part-time as an adjunct teacher at Metropolitan Community College (MCC) for a few years. I have worked at two separate Montessori schools during my career. </p>
    <p>I have worked at my current job for almost 40 years. I currently teach at a Montessori school as a primary class teacher. The primary classes are from ages 3 – 6 (or when completed with Kindergarten).</p>
    <p>I have been married once. We divorced in 1997.</p>
    <p>I have one daughter and one granddaughter.</p>
    <p>In my free time, I enjoy reading, Jazzercise, baking, shopping, spending time with family and friends, traveling, going to the theater, crafting (knitting, sewing, and crocheting), drawing, and painting.</p>
    <p>I am proud of graduating from Maynooth College. I am very proud of completing my master’s degree in business administration. I graduated at the same time as my daughter graduated from high school in 2005. One of my goals is to pursue a healthy lifestyle. Another one of my goals is to expand my spirituality.</p>
